Description:  The ownCloud sync client - github.com/owncloud/client
 .
 ownCloud client enables you to connect to your private
 ownCloud Server. With it you can create folders in your home
 directory, and keep the contents of those folders synced with your
 ownCloud server. Simply copy a file into the directory and the
 ownCloud Client does the rest.
 .
 ownCloud gives your employees anytime, anywhere access to the files
 they need to get the job done, whether through this desktop application,
 our mobile apps, the web interface, or other WebDAV clients. With it,
 your employees can easily view and share documents and information
 critical to the business, in a secure, flexible and controlled
 architecture. You can easily extend ownCloud with plug-ins from the
 community, or that you build yourself to meet the requirements of
 your infrastructure and business.
