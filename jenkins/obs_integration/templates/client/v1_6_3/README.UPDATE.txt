Attention Maintainers!
----------------------

Most of our packages in OBS are auto-generated. If you see a *.changes file
that mentiones jenkins and or branding, beware, do not change anything there.

Master sources and templates and scripts are at

 * openSUSE.org:isv:ownCloud:desktop/owncloud-client

 * git@github.com:owncloud/administration.git/ 
   jenkins/obs_integration/templates/client
   jenkins/obs_integration/genbranding.pl
   jenkins/obs_integration/setup_all_oem_clients.pl

Have fun!
